<form action="file.php" method="GET"> get is always a default method 
		<input name="login" type="text" />
		<input name="pass" type="text" />
		<input type="submit" />
	</form>

  requst will look like this: 
inputs will be converted to queryString: login=John&pass=1234


GET /file.php?login=John&pass=1234

to remove chaching we need to create a file .htaccess

# .htaccess
Header set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, max-age=0"
no-store - will prevcent caching 100%
no-cache -will prevent caching when the browser window closes only works when the session opnes and closses
max-age=0 - time of info to be actual 

HEAD is the same as GET only the server on HEAD request replies only with head without body like with GET
